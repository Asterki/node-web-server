# Node Web Server

This is a little example of how to make a node.js web server using fs and http, I also added a little audio player that will be hosted on the server, if you want to, you can add more url request and change the main page, also added a "way" to add a 404 error page, you can see it on the [server.js file](https://github.com/AsterkiDev/node-web-server/blob/master/server.js)
